* Write a simple expenses tracker application**

* The user must be able to create an account and log in.
* When logged in, user can see, edit and delete expenses he entered.
* Implement at least two roles with different permission levels (_ie: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on his owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, an admin would be able to CRUD on all records and users, etc._)
* When an expense record is entered, each one has: date, time, description, amount, comment
* User can filter expenses.
* User can print expenses per week with total amount and average day spending.
* Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
* I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is not an option.
* REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication
* You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
* In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
